Git Branching Flow – Summary 
main branch (also called master or trunk)
→ Holds the stable, production-ready code. Always up-to-date.

Feature branch
→ Created from main to develop a new feature or a breaking change.
→ Developers collaborate here independently.
→ Example: feature/login-auth.

Merge
→ Once the feature is complete and tested, the feature branch is merged into main.
→ Optionally, the branch is deleted after merging to keep the repo clean.

Release branch
→ Created from main when preparing for a production release.
→ Used for final testing, bug fixes, and polishing before deployment.
→ Example: release/v1.0.

Ship/Deploy
→ Code from the release branch is deployed to production.
→ Release is tagged for versioning (e.g., v1.0.0).

Hotfix branch
→ Created directly from main when an urgent bug or critical issue occurs in production.
→ After the fix, it's merged into both main and release branches.

→ If urgent issue: main → hotfix → fix → merge back to main and releas
